title: "About Me"
---

I'm Dominik Jarco, a writer and game developer with a penchant for the fantastical, the weird and the dark. I've been writing all my life, and have formally studied both Creative Writing and Game Design. In addition to making my own games, I'm searching for great people and teams to work with to bring worlds and stories to life.

As part of a decade-long software career, I have 3 years of hands-on-tools experience building AR/VR/XR experiences in the Unity engine, specifically for the HoloLens, HoloLens 2, and Windows Mixed Reality platforms. I have also built non-VR experiences using Unity on Windows.

I'm passionate about creating worlds and filling them with fantastical characters and vibrant histories. Games let us live lives beyond our own - they've enriched me, and I adore passing that enrichment on to others. 

If you're a kindred spirit or interested in working with me, please get in touch! Thank you for checking out my portfolio.
