### The Symbol Proofing Copy

Below is "proofing copy" generated by Twine for The Symbol. This lets the text of the entire game be reviewed without playing it.

Please note that Twine generates proofing copy with nodes sorted in alphabetical order, not in story order, so this document can't be read like a script. Instead, it provides insight into how the passages are constructed, and contains plenty of examples of my writing.
