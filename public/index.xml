      <description>The Symbol Proofing Copy Below is &amp;ldquo;proofing copy&amp;rdquo; generated by Twine for The Symbol. This lets the text of the entire game be reviewed without playing it.&#xA;Please note that Twine generates proofing copy with nodes sorted in alphabetical order, not in story order, so this document can&amp;rsquo;t be read like a script. Instead, it provides insight into how the passages are constructed, and contains plenty of examples of my writing.</description>
