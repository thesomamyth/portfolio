“I want you to kill me.”

The entire world holds still.

“Surely I must have misheard you,” you say.

The Symbol leans forward as much as it can, so its forehead is almost resting on the other side of the wall that separates you. “I want you,” it rumbles, “to end my existence.”

For a moment, all you can do is stare and reel with the implications.

"Why? *Why?*" You ask.

"I have known nothing except this chamber for what might be millions of years. I have tried to escape and each time the Regents have found me and tightened my shackles. I have tried *everything*," the Symbol says, the god who has fallen into an abyss you are only too familiar with. 

&gt;[[“After all this time, you’re giving up? You would let the Regents win like this?”]]
&gt;[[“The world needs you to give it hope. To show people that there’s something bigger than themselves out there.”]]

Another voice sounds out, echoing in the cavernous space. “*That* is not for you to decide.”

You turn. At the opposite end of the Forge, glowing white with the power of her arrival, she stands, magnanimous and lordly, hands clenched into fists. She wears a crisp military uniform, a smooth, dark blue fabric shirt tucked into heavy combat pants of the same colour, and black military boots made of sturdy leather. Her black hair is drawn back into a bun, identical to the portrait you saw of her all those years ago, and her eyes shine like miniature suns, brighter than any canvas could convey. 

Larda of the Sparkling Sea.

You try to meet her gaze, but the weight of her regard is like a physical force, pushing your head down, pressuring your body to bow.

“This has gone on long enough.” She speaks with absolute authority. 

"{shrineOutcome}{villageOutcome}{manorOutcome}"

You can’t look her in the eyes, but you can see her lips spread in a smile. “Moreover, I found the limbs you left behind at my little experiment.” She lifts up a fist suddenly clutching a handful of your hair. 

She holds your severed head aloft, barely decayed, your own dead eyes staring at you. 

The memories of that time rise up in you like vomit, and you flinch, taking a step back. The Symbol sends a mote of assurance to you.

*Steel yourself*, it says in your mind.

Larda studies you. It is like gravity doubles in strength: you have to trickle power through your bones to stay straight-backed and upright.

[if ostrichForm]
"I see you've since undone my work."
[else]
"I see you found my work to your liking."
[continue]

Larda takes a step forward, and your head vanishes from her hand. “Before I end you, you will tell me why you’ve done all this. Are you infatuated, like so many are, with the delusion of a utopian anarchy, a free world with no one at the helm? Do you think the Symbols can be brought back from the dead? Or do you simply blame me for your own mistake, for falling into my trap?”

&gt; [[“You have put me and countless others through the deepest misery. After a century of conquest, you have forgotten what it is like to be scared. I will teach you to feel fear once more.”]]
&gt; [[“People deserve freedom, and you’ve wrought enough terror on the world. The Symbols no longer have the power to challenge you, so I will assemble that power in their stead.”]]
&gt; [[“You are arrogant if you think this is about you in the slightest.

The Symbol settles itself back into a cross-legged seated position; its head would scrape the ceiling if it crossed the barrier into the Forge. “I am.”

Even being almost certain, relief floods you at the confirmation.

"And who might you be, that you have defied the Regents in seeking me out?" The Symbol asks.

Your mind is full of memories of creeping out of sight, of stern whispers to very select people, and the name that was given to you.

"I am called the Dreadbard," you say.

"A mighty name, worthy of my last disciple," the Symbol says. A thrill runs through you at its words. "Clearly the Quenching was not absolute, if enough knowledge survives that you were able to find me here."

"So much has been lost," you say.

A grim nod. "Yes. Ask what questions you wish. We have a little time before we must act."

{embed passage: 'Symbol Conversation Choices'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="&quot;What now?&quot;" tags="" position="700,1375" size="100,100">"Now, we practice with the power you have just acquired. You need to learn to use the connection, to draw power from me without injuring yourself."

Weeks of training follow. Wielding the Symbol's power is like holding up a dam made of sticks with your hands, and moving a finger just enough to trickle water through without the whole thing collapsing. It takes immense concentration, and your progress is slow as treacle, but within the cold confines of the Forge of Creation, you eventually learn that in a perverse way, your transformation at Larda's hands has a benefit.

Your animal parts seem intensely attuned to the Symbol's power. It can be channelled into your crocodile head and jaw to infuse your speech with power or exert influence over minds (though there are no minds in the Forge to practice on). You learn that your lobster claw is most receptive to raw strength, to being used as a straightforward weapon for bludgeoning and slicing. Your ostrich leg is a thing of fickle trickery. It gives you speed, unpredictability, and the capacity for illusion and deceit.

You gradually start to think of these strains of training as the Way of the Crocodile, the Way of the Lobster, and the Way of the Ostrich. As the weeks pass, it becomes clear to you that these Ways are, in some sense, mutually exclusive. Power and familiarity that you channel into one will not help you with the others, but neglecting any of them could deprive you of options were you to need them in dangerous situations.

At last, one day, the Symbol breaks from your normal routine. "We are short on time. You are now as wet clay, ready to be moulded into shape that will crystallise what you have learned so far. Ideally you'd have a lot longer to hone your powers, but I don't want to risk the Regents discovering us when you're not ready to fight back."

"So what now?" You ask.

The Symbol spreads its hands, palms up, and leans from side to side as if weighing something.  "Now, you make a choice. There are several places we can go to try your power in the real world. These places will likely impart different lessons, both to you and to me.

There is a shrine far from here, deep in the forest, where I used to take my followers to reflect and contemplate. I don't know if it still stands, and I haven't been there in a long time, but it's worth visiting.

On the other hand, it could be good to see what problems there are in an ordinary village. There is one not far from here, in the Jungle.

Lastly, there is a place in a distant desert that is of no value in growing your power, but is personal to me.

Choose wisely. Any of our activities outside the Forge could give us away to the Regents, and we may not get to see all these places before they descend upon us."

{embed passage: 'Hunger'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Announce yourself." tags="" position="1325,2300" size="100,100">You stand up and walk to the edge of the camp, arms slightly out to communicate you mean no harm. Within seconds, the alarm is raised and a semicircle of five people forms between you and the rest of the tents. They hold knives and bows, and while they don’t point them at you, they look ready to do so at any moment.

“Hold your fire, friends,” you say. “I mean you no harm.”

“What do you want?” One of them says, a gruff woman with shaggy blonde hair. She stands in a warrior’s stance, legs apart, weight light, the knife firmly in her grip.

“Merely to talk,” you say. “I am the Dreadbard, a devotee of the Lattari Symbol. I came to visit the Symbol’s old shrine and did not expect anyone else to be here.”

When you mention the Symbol, the group glances at each other meaningfully. Their scepticism doesn’t completely waver, though. 

“What happened to you?” Says another one. “Why are you like that?”

“I fell into a Regent’s trap many years ago,” you say. The pain has dulled over time, but it still isn’t a fond memory. “I was subject to a cruel experiment which left me this way.”

&gt; [[“It’s abhorrent, and I intend to reverse the process.”-&gt;Shrine Conversation]]
&gt; [[“It isn’t pleasant to look upon, but it does make me strong, fast, and subversive.”-&gt;Shrine Conversation]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Approach stealthily." tags="" position="1075,2300" size="100,100">You crouch down and creep between the trees until you can make out the conversations. By and large, this seems to be talk about the mundane matters of managing a camp: hunting, trapping, gathering, meal preparation, and watch shifts. You gather these people have been here for a long time, maybe months, judging by the practised way they hash out rosters and plans. 

You listen for a few minutes, but hear nothing else of note.

&gt; [[Announce yourself.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Approach the manor." tags="" position="300,4950" size="100,100">The front door isn’t even locked, and you enter a grand antechamber. The walls are lined with huge landscape paintings above glass cases with what are clearly battle trophies. Helms, spearheads, amulets and arrows are displayed on plush, glossy black cushions.

You stop to listen for movement, but hear none.

“I expected more guards,” you say.

*As did I.*

You move through the ground floor and up a spiral staircase that takes you to the top floor.
[if befriendedHounds]
The hounds you befriended spread out through the first few chambers, sniffing at everything they see.
[if dominatedHounds]
The hounds you bent to your will stay by the front door, on alert for danger.
[continue]

You keep your senses sharp for any noise or movement, but the house seems totally empty. Every wall, every shelf strains with decorations: landscapes and portraits, fine plates and bowls, tomes, quills, individual bones and partially reconstructed skeletons, chalices, sealed vials and bottles filled with unknown liquids, armour, saddles, pincers, surgical implements, daggers, swords, axes, bows, crossbows, arrows and bolts. So many different cultures and parts of the world are captured here, symbols of all that the Regents have stolen. 

At last, you find it, mounted like any other trophy. Amongst the gleaming resplendence displayed here, a hammer forged of metal from the core of the world seems almost understated: it is a single piece of worked iron, but with a deep red gleam where daylight hits it. It is held up on the wall by a thick metal bracket. The simple plaque beneath it reads: *Partum, the Hammer of Ending*.

You find yourself inside a paradox: a perfect circle of ice, ringed by desert sand. Wind sings across blood orange dunes that undulate in every direction, but when you step forward, your feet clink with frost. The air fizzes with power; you can taste its sourness.

The wind flings grains of sand at you, but they fall to the ground midair before they can touch the ice. It is as if the ice is guarded by a wall of invisible glass, yet when you walk to the edge and put your hand out, you encounter no resistance. The air beyond is sweltering, and sand stings your knuckles.

*To become a Symbol, I had to absolutely embody persistence,* the Lattari Symbol says in your mind. *More than what any living being could demonstrate. There is no more primal an example of persistence than cold enduring neverending heat.*

“So your power doesn’t stem from you being a Symbol,” you say, your breath misting in front of your face. “You had power already.”

*Power is not something you have. It is something you are. At their roots, the Symbols and the Regents are similar in that we all embody power.*

When you return, the Symbol is sitting in the corner of its prison, an enormous hunched figure with its arms around its knees, staring at nothing.

It comes to when you step past the great anvil in the center of the Forge, turning its head to look at you. "Where to next?"

When you return, the Symbol looks up immediately. It gives you a nod as you approach. "Where to next?"

“Hey!” He calls out. “Who are you? You can’t be here!”

You ignore him, and gather power and mass into your lobster claw. It becomes heavier, and you run power through your body to support it, and your legs to propel you towards the gate. You gather more and more, drawing from the well that is the Symbol, until your whole being resonates like a humming bell. 

You charge. A few steps that kick up dirt in your wake, then you launch yourself at the gate, claw first. The gate makes a horrible metallic clang as you punch into it, cleaving a section of the metal bars straight off and sending them flying across the cobblestones. You barrel through the gap, landing on your feet and looking up at the guard.

The trembling guard has his crossbow pointed squarely at your chest.

At first, you turn and run in the opposite direction, feeling your feet hit the cobblestones. Enticed by the prospect of fleeing prey, the hounds speed up, stretching out into a loose line as some peel ahead of the others. This is exactly what you wanted.

You slow, letting them gain, and then whirl around at the last minute and shove your claw through the lead hound. It yelps and squeals as you lift its whole body up into the air for its packmates to see. The others reel and jump back in fear – you press your attack, hurling the body you hold at one of them, then delivering a swift kick with your ostrich foot to another. The two you strike tumble backwards, thrown to the ground through the force of your blows. You bend down and unleash a crocodilian roar at the last two hounds, who are already retreating.

With one dead, and two wounded, the pack limps away from you. They’ll trouble you no more.

You have plenty of nightmares to choose from, and your current situation provides plentiful inspiration. Drawing on the power within you, you wrap your own mind in an illusion. You recall the abandoned mine in the Old Asturan Jungle. The terror of waking. The moment of comprehension of what was done to you. Done to you by the person before you.

Like all nightmares, it lasts an indeterminate amount of time, but when you come to, groggy and hoarse-throated, it flees from your waking mind like fog from the dawn. Your whole body feels like it’s been branded. Every tiny movement hurts, and you involuntarily groan in pain.

Larda turns. She stands in the centre of the Forge, looking at the Symbol, which is in turn looking at you, putting on a very convincing act of losing all hope; defeat practically oozes from its slumped shoulders, its hands trailing on the floor.

Larda approaches you. Partum, the Hammer of Ending, is in her hand, thrumming with power. “I wanted you to be awake for the end,” she says. “No sense in wasting a moment like this. Oh, the sweet taste of victory.”

She looks at the Hammer as she puts it over her shoulder. “This is very much overkill, but I have so few opportunities to use this weapon, and… it’s going to be so satisfying to watch you just *disappear*.”

The idea alights in your mind like a candle in an abyss. The Symbol’s connection hums with concord; it understands even without communicating.

 “Any last words?” Larda asks.

&gt; [["The total domination you crave is a myth. The tighter you squeeze your fists, the harder those that are left will oppose you."-&gt;Larda's Defeat]]
&gt; [["I was able to match you in power with mere weeks of practice. I expected more. You should be ashamed."-&gt;Larda's Defeat]]

The words you invoke rebound across the Forge like a drum beat. A horrific sound like the shrieks of a dying crowd fill the space as an oblivion mass shaped like an immense cloak of stars appears before you. Tentacles writhe from beneath it, some holding ancient pages blistered like skin, daubed with primordial text that hurts your eyes to even glimpse. Heat flares from the monster as if from a volcano. 

You focus your attention on Larda, and the monster’s attention shifts with yours. It launches a torrent of limbs at her, grasping, cutting off escape routes, pinning her down. It waves its scriptures in her face and you swear you can hear phantom whispers reciting histories that were only written down so they could be forgotten.

Larda counterattacks. Scythes and blades of white light sever tentacles and limbs, set fire to pages. She moves quicker than your eyes can follow, darting out of the monster’s reach, then bringing to life an immense spear. The monster wraps its tentacles around the shaft, but too late, and the brilliant spearhead pierces deep into its cloak. It shrieks ever louder, but Larda shouts a battlecry that drowns it out.

Though the conjuring has put you almost at the limits of your strength, you rush at Larda in person, taking advantage of her distraction. You sink your teeth into her shoulder, tasting salty, bloody meat, and she cries out, then blasts you away with a palm strike to the chest that sends you into the far wall of the Forge. 

You look up to see the thing you’ve conjured fade into black tendrils that snake between the stones and through the floor.

Back and forth down the switchback steps you go. The walls enclose you, bringing on gloom as they hem out the chirring jungle and the sky. The air cools. By the time you reach the bottom, you resolve the main features of the work yard you step into.

Next to a mound of earth is a mineshaft, claustrophobically small and held up by old, dry wooden poles that may well crumble into dust if touched. Spread throughout the yard are whipping posts with cuffs and bindings attached – a surprising number. Dried blood smears the wood and the surrounding stone. And on your left, a pair of bronze-gilded stone columns stand sentinel before a vast hallway that stretches out of sight.

You raise the Hammer of Linking above your head. You didn’t need much power to wield it the first time, and this time, even with the Symbol shrinking its connection to you, you have enough. 

You bring it down, and this time it is as if all existence folds into a tube, with you at one end, the Symbol at the other. Energy builds inside you, leaking from your eyes, your mouth, and when you roar, a blinding white lance of power roars down the connection.

“No,” the Symbol says. “Please, no. Don’t do this. No!”

The lance of power strikes it in the centre of the forehead, spiralling, drilling into the Symbol’s head. It tries to move its head, but your power and the power of the Hammer of Linking locks it in place as the lance pushes harder and harder – then slips inside.

The Symbol explodes. Suddenly you are back in the Forge, in physical reality, and you can feel the Symbol’s mind like it’s a limb – you are more than connected. It is yours to shape, to squeeze into a form that can escape the prison it’s in. It will need to lose much.

You draw out the power, the knowledge, the experience, even some of the emotion. All of these flood around you and hang as clouds, as streaks, as beads and swarms of light and darkness in the Forge.

What doesn’t make it is independence and self-reliance and a lot of superfluous personality. You leave those in the Symbol’s prison, to dissolve into nothing, while you draw the rest out through the amplified connection  you’ve created. They coalesce into a smaller form, one roughly the same size as you, but still reminiscent of what the Symbol looked like earlier – albeit this time you give it a mouth.

The form twitches slightly as you finish putting it together, and then you let the power drain from you. Even as you do so, you become aware of your dominance of the Symbol’s mind. The connection between you is no longer a mere exchange of ideas and thoughts – it is a leash that you hold.

“Master,” the Symbol says in a flat voice, looking at you. It holds up a hand to its new mouth, feeling this new part of its anatomy. You now stand side by side, of equal height, and slowly the Symbol bows to you. “Thank you for freeing me.”

It was strengthened through the places you visited. It was strengthened by the fight with Larda.

Partum rips it away from you like a strip of loose skin.

Then it begins to pull from your body. You can only watch in horror as your physical form diminishes, and the Forge begins to break apart. You feel fat and muscle vanishing from your body, being eaten by the ravenous hammer. Cracks form in the ceiling, and stalactites spear down into the ground. Your very thoughts are emptying, memories fading away like dreams.

“No!” The Symbol cries, jerking its head up to look at you. “I asked you to do it safely! Stop! It’s killing you!”

Somewhere, stone shrieks in collapse. You can feel each one of your bones. Whiteness creeps in the edges of your vision, and your ribs are beginning to fray. It is a matter of moments before you are gone.

&gt;[[“All my life I’ve longed to see you, to speak with you.

You keep a hold of it, so the torrential pull from the Hammer doesn’t rip it away all at once, and feed it enough to sustain yourself.

Somewhere, stone shrieks in collapse. Water pours in from the ceiling. The Symbol slumps onto the ground, cracks forming in its skin, eyes blazing with pain as it looks towards you.

“Goodbye,” it says, and crumbles.

The Hammer ceases its work and you finally wrench yourself free. Drained, barely standing, you nevertheless sprint, dodging a falling column that smashes into bits as the whole Forge begins to cave in. You reach for the marbled anvil icon that brought you here all those years ago, and in an instant you find yourself back in the jungle.

The calm and quiet is unsettling after the chaos. The ground underneath you begins to shift, and you back away, moving deeper into the jungle, until you’re sure you’re safe.

There, you allow yourself a moment of mourning for the being you looked up to, venerated your whole life. The being you killed at its own request.

As you move through the Jungle, onto wherever your journey next takes you, you will always carry the Symbol’s memory in your heart. 

Whatever happens next, the Lattari Symbol has found peace.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Disclaimer" tags="" position="150,125" size="100,100">shrineTwisted: false

The time for subtlety is over.

With a swing of the hammer, you smash the curtain and the window into bits, showering the soldiers with glass and drawing their attention. They look up at you as you leer from the window. You gather power within your throat, and when you unleash it, it forms words that crackle and snap through the air like lightning. 

*“IGNI AZA NIHI THOPH. OSSEIAN YUGOT IEDERN.”*

The Symbol’s voice joins with yours. The whole courtyard darkens, and you feel your face stretch and swelter into an even more horrifying visage. The soldiers reel back from you, grown men and women’s voices turned shrill and husky with terror.

*“MARTARUM. VOLD PHNGLUI, KOSOMOS OMEN IYABIS.”*

It is as if the sky itself presses closer upon them. They look at each other, ordinarily friends and allies, and bloody mayhem breaks out. With berserker battle cries, they rush at each other. One soldier impales another on his polearm. Four of them enter a frantic fight of swords and fists, rules of engagement thrown out. 

[if befriendedHounds || dominatedHounds]
The hounds you had turned to your side burst from the lower levels of the house, snarling and biting, adding to the carnage.

[continue]
At least one unfortunate soul has retained enough of her sanity to understand what is happening to her friends. “Deya, no!” She shouts as another advances on her with a sword. “It’s me! It’s me, Maria! You know me – my love, please, please, NO!” 

Deya plunges her sword into Maria’s neck. Maria tries to scream, but it turns into a gargle as blood gushes from her throat. Her eyes never leave Deya’s face, pleading til the life leaves her and she lies still.

You stand at the window, a beacon of fear and chaos. A perverse satisfaction runs through you as you watch the carnage you have wrought. You stand there until the ringing of steel and the screams and the whimpers of pain die down, and nothing is left but a faint breeze blowing over the corpses.

Once it is quiet, you turn away and when the power leaves you, your face returns to its normal form. 

You mentally nudge the Symbol, and in an instant, [[return to the Forge-&gt;Self Transformation]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Drop to your knees in awe, drinking in the sight of your god." tags="" position="1625,550" size="100,100">The Symbol looms over you like a tidal wave. You fall to your knees, just *looking*. Even imprisoned, it lives and persists. This is the most ancient of all beings, old and wise as the world, as the trees and the stones that have seen empires rise and fall over aeons.

{embed passage: 'Symbol Speaks'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Ensnared" tags="" position="400,50" size="100,100">Venturing into the Old Asturan Jungle is not forbidden by law.

“The jungle makes its own laws,” your uncle Yuthan, tall and stubbly and grand as always in his crimson judge’s garb, tells you when you propose it. “It enforces them ruthlessly, without the slightest care or regard. There’s a reason the Regents abandoned it after the Quenching.”

You have always placed more weight on the whispers that after the Quenching, the Mercantine Regents’ resources were so spent that they were forced to consolidate territories, or else be spread too thin to enshrine their rule.

You go into the Jungle anyway.

Why?

&gt; [[The Regents’ wealth is countless. There are rumours of unclaimed treasure that even the Regents left untouched. You were never poor, but an influx of wealth could invigorate your flailing studies of the Lattari Symbol.]]
&gt; [[The Regents wish they could purge the citizenry of unsanitary knowledge. Perhaps they abandoned the Jungle because it contains knowledge they would prefer remained hidden. Knowledge pertaining to the Lattari Symbol.]]
&gt; [[Not all submit willingly to the mechanisms of gavel and coin that the Mercantine Regents have established.

The small size of the shaft implies two things: whatever this operation was for must have been valuable in small quantities, and the miners must have known where to dig for it. You gaze into the shaft and over the earth piled up next to it, but no glint or colour catches your eye.

You understand the purpose of a whipping post, but you count fifteen in total. Even with an unruly crew, surely one or two would have sufficed. Such a large number, and the clear signs of heavy use, suggest the torture was about more than bringing troublemakers into line.

{embed passage: 'Courtyard Choices'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Explore the surrounding area." tags="" position="1200,2175" size="100,100">Though you could just jump, you look around the walls of Lapaña for an easy way up and see a spot where the vines have been cut away. Stones have been embedded into the wall as handholds.

“This is recent,” you say.

*Yes.* The puzzlement in the Symbol’s voice is obvious. *This place was always hidden. We are in deep forest where no trails lead; I would use my power to transport my followers here when they asked, and back to civilisation when they were ready to return.*

“How far are we from the nearest settlement?”

*Weeks of hiking from what was once called New Seter to the east; I do not know what the Regents call it now. Whoever is here must be desperately trying to escape something.*

“Or trying to find something.”

You climb up the handholds and sharpen your senses once you reach the top. Your journey here followed the faintest of traces; the tracks left here may as well be sun-bright. Following them is trivial, and becomes even easier once you pick up the clinking and scuffling of a nearby camp. Canvas tents point up from between the trees. At least half a dozen voices chatter; they sound relaxed.

Your whole body resonates like a viol string as you call on the Symbol’s power. You hold up your claw and watch as it fades into little more than a heat shimmer before your eyes. Looking down, you can barely see yourself at all. You edge through the crowd, careful not to make contact with anyone, as the judge places her hand on the lever that controls the gallows’ trapdoor.

You reach the front just as the trapdoor opens, and sprint the last few steps to catch Awoth’s hobbled feet square on your shoulders. Straining, you reach up with your hands to support her weight, amplifying your strength with the Symbol’s.

“What is this?” You hear from above, and shocked murmurs run through the crowd as the librarian seemingly hangs beneath the gallows, unharmed and breathing. “What have you done?”

“Nothing! I – I don’t know!” Awoth says.

You snip the bonds around her feet, then murmur softly enough for only Awoth to hear. “When I cut the rope, run.”

She makes a squeak of fright which you take as assent. Pulling on the thread that connects you to the Symbol, your human arm tingles as you pump strength into it to hold her up single-handed. You reach up with your claw and cut through the rope around her neck. A gasp runs through the crowd; even invisible, there’s no hiding that.

You lower Awoth to the ground, and she lurches to her feet and starts running. You dash ahead of her unseen, pushing the exclaiming crowd out of the way, clearing her a path. In minutes, you are both in the jungle, and you let yourself become visible.

Awoth shrinks back in instinctive fear. “You… saved me?” She glances around as if looking for an escape route.

“I’m not going to hurt you,” you say.

“I suppose you did just save my life,” she says. “Why? Do I know you? I feel like I’d recognise you if I knew you.”

With a flick of your wrists you turn yourself invisible, flanking right while an illusory double of you rushes towards Larda.

Right as the illusion reaches her, it disappears. Instantly you create another that rushes her from a different direction, then two, then three. Larda dodges and blocks, evading the strikes while looking from side to side, trying to spot the real you. 

You conjure another illusion, standing on the opposite side of her. "I'm here, Larda," you say, making the fake speak with your voice. She runs towards it, and you -- the real you -- descend on her from behind.

Her fist swings through nothing, and the illusion dissipates. With the full force of your body and with glowing power infusing your feet, you deliver a leaping kick with both feet to the middle of her spine that yanks her off her feet and sends her sprawling. She grunts as her breath leaves her. She rolls limp across the ground.

You follow. She manages to get into a crouch before you reach her. A flurry of punches and blocks fills the space between you, the slaps of flesh on flesh resounding. Her face is screwed up in concentration, and you prey on that. Illusory arms and fists sprout from your shoulders and you control them all like puppets, a mesmering pattern of fake strikes that Larda cannot withstand.

You land a hit, and another, swift punches to her jaw and cheekbones. She deflects a blow and raises her arm against another, but it turns out to be an illusion that leaves her vulnerable to a punch to the temple.

Larda sways, eyes rolling momentarily, but continues to block two punches even while on the verge of consciousness. When she comes to, her eyes narrow in anger and emanate power, glowing so bright they're hard to look at.

When they erupt, twin beams of blinding energy slam into your chest, blasting you across the Forge and slamming you into the far wall. You tumble to the ground and groan. For a moment, pain is all there is.

{embed passage: 'Larda Fight Common 2'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Finding the Hammer" tags="" position="300,3500" size="100,100">When you return to the Forge of Creation, the Symbol addresses you immediately. “One of the Regents has just pulled a significant portion of power from me.”

“Larda?”

The Symbol’s luminescent eyes are fixed on you. “Perhaps. Even if it isn’t, we can’t take the chance. We must move to retrieve the fifth hammer now. Through a perverse stroke of fortune, I know where it is kept.”

&gt; [[“How do you know that?”]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Force the guard to open the gate for you." tags="" position="300,4050" size="100,100">You step into the guard’s line of sight.

“Hey!” He says, looking at you with wide eyes. “Who are you? You can’t be here!”

You open your jaws wide and roar at him, wrapping him in the grip of your power. His face scrunches up with pain; he drops the crossbow and grasps at his head with his hands. “What – what are you doing?” He garbles out. “Stop! Stop!”

“Open the gate,” you command.

Bent over double now, he shakes his head. “No, I – I can’t!”

In response, you intensify the power wrapping him. He tries to scream as his own chainmail squeezes his body, but you constrict his throat at the same time.

“Open the gate.”

Frantically, he waves his hands at you to stop, nodding in an exaggerated motion. You release him and he briefly drops out of your sight behind the wall; you can hear him gasping and coughing. Slowly, the gate grinds open; you slip inside as soon as it’s high enough to crouch under. You straighten up on the other side and make eye contact with the guard just as he releases the winch he’d been winding. The gate slams shut once again.

The guard eyes you warily, then leaps for his dropped crossbow.

{embed passage: 'Guard Crossbow'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Forging" tags="" position="1525,1650" size="100,100">The Symbol lets the Forge fill with silence before beginning to speak.

“This place was built specifically to contain and harness a Symbol’s power. Even as they neared the end of the Quenching, the Regents had already decided not to wipe us out entirely, but to use one of us for their own empowerment.” The Symbol points to the anvil behind you. “Go to the anvil, and find the hammer with the whitewood shaft.”

You ascend the steps to the dais and look around at the four hammers. One of them has a long shaft of bleached wood, carved with an icon: two spheres linked with a thin line. The hammer head itself resembles this icon, slimmer in the centre and with rounded corners on the ends. The metal is pale bronze in colour, and absent of filigree or other decoration.

You lift the hammer off its rack, and it takes all your strength to merely lower it to the ground without stumbling.

“Each Regent is linked to me like a bucket linked with rope to a well, and all but Larda used that hammer to create the connection,” the Symbol says. “They can draw on my power no matter where in the world they are. We must link you the same way.”

“Why?”

“The fifth hammer was forged in a single piece, made of molten metal from the stillborn sun at the core of the world. The Regents created it as a last resort: it will destroy both me, and the entire Forge of Creation.”

You look around for it. “There are only four here.”

“It is not kept here,” the Symbol says. “Larda keeps it elsewhere; she does not trust the other Regents. We will need to retrieve it, and you will need to be as strong as a Regent in the moment you swing it,” the Symbol says.

“As strong as a Regent?” You ask in disbelief. “And you can just give me that power once we are linked?”

“No,” the Symbol says, shaking its head, “you would burn up like powdered wood. But if you become strong enough, I can amplify your power and get you the rest of the way for the time it takes to use the hammer. Our goal now is to strengthen you both physically and magically as much as we can before the Regents realise that we’re up to something.

“Luckily, the Regents were only human when they swung the hammer you now hold. No ritual or incantation is required. Simply strike the anvil with it.”

You grasp the hammer with hand and claw. Heaving with all your strength, you intend to swing it up onto your shoulders, but get only part of the way before its weight overcomes you, and you only just manage to shift it so it is over the anvil when it falls back down.

White, shattering cracks appear in the anvil’s glimmering surface, and you feel like you have been cracked as well. It is as if you are growing bigger, your awareness expands past your skin into the cold air of the Forge of Creation. You feel a pulling, a keenness in the direction of the Symbol, and you let yourself be stretched, reaching further but thinner, homing in on that wall of far more than mere rock. 

You are taut and crystalline.

You touch the wall of the Symbol’s prison.

Wind and noise explode down the connection. Your body reels and screams as it is filled far past bursting, far past your skin – it is your very essence, that primal and eternal self that grows and grows, filling with cold light and reticent power.

The tether, the line that is also you between your body and the wall begins to fray. You know that if you are not safely back within your body when it snaps, you will be lost forever. You urge yourself on as if you are riding a horse, a torrent, a waterfall. You slam back into your mismatched feet. Rise through your chest. 

The connection splinters and the last fibres fray.

In an instant, you are once again only a soul within a vessel of flesh.

But that flesh has been amplified, and you feel a glowing pool of power in your abdomen, swirling like a concoction in a cauldron.

“It is done,” the Symbol says.

The anvil is as dark as before. The hammer lies on the ground next to it. Shaking, you lift it, and find that although it is still heavy, your claw can now hold it aloft and mount it on its rack.

&gt; [["What now?"]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="Get inside her guard and strike first." tags="" position="1925,4350" size="100,100">Instead of dodging, you advance, leaping forward with your ostrich leg and landing on your elephant leg with a stomp that shakes the floor. She doesn’t expect it, and is forced to let the long range whip dissipate. She begins reshaping her second weapon into something shorter and straighter – a sword perhaps – but you are relentless, flinging out your tentacles with incredible speed, forcing her to move.

[if strikeFear]
You reach up with your claw and slice through the rope around your neck, landing on your feet. The growth on your throat shrinks. People reel back; some start running. 

[continue]
You advance, and the crowd churns before you as people try to get away. You step out from under the gallows and look up at the judge. She looks back with as much fear as the rest of them.

Before any of them can gather their wits enough to band together and attack you, you flee into the jungle.

&gt; [[Return to the Forge.-&gt;Noticed Aftermath]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Hit her with everything you’ve got." tags="" position="2050,4650" size="100,100">You wrap your tentacles around her throat. Her eyes bulge wide as you bend your knees and spring, pulling yourself towards her.

Larda raises her hand, and a glowing blade appears in it. With a stroke she slices downwards, severing the ends of your tentacles. Pain snakes through you, but you're already hurtling through the air towards her. You cry out as you slam into her with your claw, savouring the snap of bone the armoured scales make on contact. Larda is sent tumbling backwards, but lands on hands and knees, her eyes full of fury.

Blood seeps through her navy blue uniform as she gets to her feet. You leap into the air, almost to the ceiling of the Forge, and elongate your tentacles into a single mass that whips through the air like the appendage of a sea creature whose names are whispered in horror tales.

You aim for her feet, and Larda leaps into the air to avoid being tripped, but at the peak of your arc you slice through a chunk of stalactites and they fall towards her. A bark from your crocodile mouth imbues them with speed and they shoot and curve to intercept Larda.

She spreads her fingers in the air and a circular shield of light materialises before her. The stalactites crumble to bits on its surface, and then all you see is her face as she speeds towards you.

She hits you so hard you hit and scrape the ceiling. Stones and smaller stalactites pierce your cloak and rake your skin; warm blood wells up from the wounds.

Larda has by now begun falling again, and you are still above her. As you fall, you draw strength and mass into your elephant leg, making yourself heavier.

She lands with a ready stance, and dread fills you when you see the look in her eyes. Right before you hit her, she grabs your leg with both hands, swings you around in a horizontal arc, and sends you crashing headfirst into the wall of the Forge.

Hope leaps in your chest. “To travel with the Lattari Symbol? Of course, *of course* I’d love that.”

A wave of happiness through the connection.

You find you can hold it for as long as you want. There is no pain, no pressure longing to be released. There is only the air inside you, as still as dust.

You stride forward, muscling people out of the way. Gasps and shouts sound out around you as people see you and start moving out of your way, but you don’t look at them. Your eyes are locked on the judge. 

You reach the front, pushing the last few people out of the way, and extend your claw towards the judge. “Let her go,” you say.

“Who are you?” The judge asks, her eyes darting side to side. She is unarmed.

You begin walking towards the gallows. “I am the Dreadbard, a disciple of the Lattari Symbol.” You don’t bother with the steps, but draw the Symbol’s power into your legs. With a tingling rush you leap straight up, somersaulting and twisting over the judge. You land behind her, facing out onto the crowd. Before she can react, you pull her against you and put your claw to her throat. “Let her go, or it is your life that will end today.”

You feel the judge’s throat move as she swallows. “Go, Awoth. Quickly.”

The librarian, Awoth, looks at you.

“I have no idea who you are, but thank you.” A mix of relief, confusion, and anticipation mark her features.

She steps off the gallows and runs into the jungle, her footsteps fading away into silence. 

The judge trembles in your grasp. “I’ve done as you asked. Let me go.”

The time has come to make the final choice. Partum is in your hand, its dark metal ready to claim the life of the last living Symbol. 

But the Forge also holds other hammers.

Just as you applied the {hammerUsed} to yourself, each of these hammers, if applied to the Symbol, would have a different effect.

You are familiar enough with the process now, and the will that goes into shaping a hammer’s strike, to roughly predict what those effects will be.

The simplest option is, of course, to do nothing. Perhaps the Symbol should stay here - after all, it supplies you with your power as well as the Regents.

All other options depend solely on what type of power you’ve amassed, and how much.

There is the original plan - use Partum to end the Symbol and destroy the Forge of Creation. The hammer cares not what kind of power it receives – a void is a void, after all – only that it receives enough. As per the Symbol’s warning, if you are not strong enough, it will consume you to finish its work.

[if crocodile &gt;= successThreshold]
There is the Hammer of Linking, with its whitewood shaft. You could use it to bind the Symbol to you more strongly – exclusively, in fact, cutting off its supply of power to the other Regents. Doing so would obliterate its free will, drawing it out of its prison at the cost of making it your thrall.

[if lobster &gt;= successThreshold]
The Hammer of Ultimatum would draw out and magnify a single thread of the Symbol’s personality. The Symbol’s will would be freed, but aspects of its person would be lost. Its entire being would become focused on bringing down the Regents, and getting revenge for all it has lost.

[if ostrich &gt;= successThreshold]
There is the Hammer of Excess, which would reach out and strain the Symbol from its prison like flour through a sieve. Its corporeal form would be destroyed, as would its coherent will. It would be scattered through the universe, embodied in every cloud and every sword, perhaps making a flower bloom here and there if it could muster the will. That might bring it peace, but it would never meaningfully influence the world again.

[if perfectEnding]
The last and most daring, most improbable option is the Hammer of Reversal, which you could use to, rather than breaking or bypassing its prison, undo the *act* of the Symbol’s imprisonment. It would free the Symbol and leave both it and the Forge intact and unchanged – but it would take so much power that only the most staunchly devoted disciple could manage it.

By day you trudge among the lizards, and mosquitoes hound you at night. Your lips crack; your feet blister, then your blisters submit to callouses. Your food and water supplies dwindle faster than you expected: hacking through the jungle takes its toll on your body.

You supplement your water from streams, but hunting and trapping are far rarer skills than they used to be, and you certainly do not possess them.

Astura is right on the southeast corner of the Regents’ official borders. Judging from the scraps of old maps you were able to source two years ago, your journey takes you into the territory of what was once the nation of Roka, colonised by the Regents before the Quenching ever began. 

What it took to get those maps sometimes makes you laugh. Sometimes it makes you shudder.

You let your anger at all the Regents have done rise to the surface of your thoughts. “You deserve this for serving them, for enforcing their tyrannical laws.”

The judge tries to jerk away but you hold her fast, drawing on the Symbol’s power to do so. You squeeze her throat and immediately feel warm, wet blood gush down your claw. The judge makes a strangled whimper of fear and pain, pushing and striking you with her hands to no avail. Screams sound from the crowd; someone throws a rock, but it bounces harmlessly off you.

You squeeze harder, harder, until the judge’s throat gives way and your claw clicks together. Her body slumps forward. Blood runs between the gallows’ planks.

As you ascend those few short stone steps, you feel the Symbol’s power in you, but you also feel your own. You stand at the anvil, looking at the being that you have admired, if not venerated, all your life.

*I can’t defeat her in a straight fight*, you send to the Symbol. *Help me!*

The Symbol responds. *She’s drawing on my power heavily. So are you, of course, but I can try to cut off the flow of my power to her at the right time. That could create an opportunity for you to land a solid hit. It’ll have to be a killing blow. It may not actually kill her, but should buy you enough time to kill me and escape.*

“You’ve done well,” Larda says, “to become so strong without one of us noticing. Shame that you oppose us; you could have been a good thrall. But it’s time to stop playing.”

Given she’s just powered through everything you’ve thrown at her, there’s only one way to get inside her guard.

She raises Partum over her head in both hands, and right as she begins the downward swing of her arms -- 

*Now!*

The hammer falls past her head, her fingers fumbling as the Symbol cuts off Larda’s power. Before she can replenish from her own well, you burst from your bindings, step to her with blinding speed, and grab the falling hammer. You channel its momentum into a spin and whirl to strike through Larda’s outstretched hands, shattering her forearms and elbows, crushing her ribcage and smashing her lungs and heart to bits. 

The momentum of the strike flings her away from you. As she crumbles, her very being disintegrating like dust, her face forms an expression of shock, and then a dawning horror as she stares at her own end. 

A second later, she is gone. 

The space smells of smoke. On the floor where Larda was, there is a small pile of ash.

“Yes,” the Symbol says, disbelief and elation in its voice, then it laughs. “Haha, yes! Yes, yes! You did it! She’s gone! She’s actually gone!” It hammers its fists on the invisible wall of its prison in jubilation.

The first thing you feel is the warmer air; not as warm as the jungle, but certainly more pleasant than the frigid cavern the Forge is housed in. Pine trees reach up to entangle their branches in an impressively thick canopy. The afternoon sky is overcast; what little light pierces the forest’s ceiling is pale and diffuse.

“Where are we?” You ask.

*In a secret place,* the Symbol says in your mind. *Lapaña, the Sanctuary of the Wooded Soul. I only gave my most devout the incantations to pass the wardings; anyone else would be diverted elsewhere. The wardings are gone now, but it is still hidden in the forest. Find it.*

Hours of searching follow. You tap into the Symbol’s power, feeling it tingle in your eyes, your ears and snout. Colours split into shades like white light through a prism. Pine needles crackle with your every step. Distant deer pad carefully between the trees, and the loamy scents of the forest thicken to the point of taste.

You navigate by the barest remains of tracks that would have been totally invisible if the pine needles had not worked to suppress the growth of the forest floor. Your eyes itch as the Symbol sends strength down the connection, and traces of normally invisible power appear as pearlescent clouds. *The remains of the wardings. You are close. Continue.*

Pine branches rasp against your skin as you follow the faint thread of remnant power in the air. The trees press so closely it becomes hard to see, and you have to physically push through, then all at once they disappear.

You stand at the precipice of a large circular space below, clear of trees and bathed in daylight - whether it’s a natural sinkhole or dug out by sentient hands, you couldn’t say. Creeper vines with three-pronged leaves cover the sides, while patches of grass intersperse with mossy cobblestone on the ground. 

In the centre stands a huge stone sculpture, emanating from a central pedestal in acute angles and thick, squared off lines. It makes no sense to you - perhaps it is a glyph of an ancient alphabet, or simply abstract art. Vines have attempted to wrap themselves around it to varying degrees of success, and spots of lichen brighten the base. A red-brown beetle steps gingerly across one of the stems.

You jump down. The moment your mismatched feet touch the ground, tranquillity and solitude settle over you like a coat of snow.

You rear your head back and your crocodile mouth makes a deep, guttural barking. For years, tension and constant threat have made themselves at home in the marrow of your bones; now they loosen as you cackle at the sight before you: the last living god, your hope for yourself and for a better world.

For a moment, you soar straight over the wall, metres of stone construction no match for the sheer velocity in your jump.

“What the –” you hear from below, and turn your head to see the guard pointing his crossbow at you. However, you have no time to worry about that as you arc towards the ground, gathering speed all the way. You gather power once more and bend your mismatched knees in opposite directions, your legs forming a diamond shape as you absorb the impact of your landing. Shock and pain still shoot through you, and you tumble and roll to the ground.

You look up to see the guard, mouth open in shock, pointing his crossbow squarely at your chest.

{embed passage: 'Guard Crossbow'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="Leave the courtyard." tags="" position="1425,175" size="100,100">Your pack is gone. You have no supplies. Even the thought of re-entering the ruins to retrieve them is quarantined behind a mental chasm. Inconceivable. 

Night descends, and you lie on jungle soil, completely sleepless. Grief tugs at you like an insistent child somewhere in your spirit, and you keep slapping its hand away. To focus on anything else, you wonder how, exactly, it was done.

You can’t imagine any surgeon, no matter how talented, could have done this. If such things were possible, amputees wouldn’t exist.

The portrait of Larda stares at you in your mind’s eye. They say nothing is impossible for the Mercantine Regents. Could it have been her, or someone in her service? The most powerful people in the world surely have better things to do than wait for hapless adventurers to fall into their traps so they can experiment on them.

Even if it wasn’t Larda, she could reverse this, but the chances of her wanting to, or you ever meeting her, are nonexistent, however. The brief flare of hope you felt dies, then resurges. Who would have the power to oppose the Mercantine Regents, and the desire to do so?

Not all the gods are dead.

Somewhere, absent and hidden for a hundred years, the Lattari Symbol lives. 
Voluntarily, you take a breath, the damp night air swirling in your mouth. The curiosity that has surrounded the Lattari Symbol since your childhood sharpens into pressing, urgent, tangible need. 

Ever since you first asked your mother at six years old why the Regents left one god alive. Whenever you wondered how the Regents became so powerful. When you looked at the official maps of the Delineated District of Astura and called oppression what others called efficiency: the lifelong occupations decided for the vast majority of people, the closed borders and forbidden travel, the public and violent punishments for minor crimes. The destruction of books.

The Lattari Symbol, the question of all questions. A second heartbeat in your chest, a thrilling expedition that always sounded too good to be true, too grand to even attempt.
Now you must attempt it, or spend the rest of your life like this, not knowing why this has been done to you.

“I told you I was going to make this the worst pain you’ve ever experienced,” she says, and the bands of light wrapping you begin to warm.

You need to survive this with your sanity intact. As the heat grows into discomfort, the bands split and press down, needles of hot iron piercing your clothes and your skin.

With one bound you leap up to the top of the sculpture, and as your ostrich foot touches its cold metal top, the whole structure shudders. The air is filled with leafy susurrations; vines from all around the clearing snake towards the metal, climbing up, embracing it. The steel beneath your feet crumples with a sound like wood crackling in fire, and waves of wood and bark ripple down. 

In seconds, the sculpture is no more. In its place stands a magnificent tree with four trunks joined at the base, each trunk with its own branches and deciduous leafy canopy. Vines wrap around the branches, their scarlet and indigo flowers hanging from them like decorations. As you leap back down to the ground, a flock of robins swoops in from overhead and disperses into the tree, filling the previously silent air with their tweets.

“The Symbol is as ancient as the earth. It needs no sculpture to represent it. It is as enduring as the very ground beneath our feet.”

“What did you find?” You ask.

“They portrayed a very different account of the Quenching than what I was taught growing up,” she shifts uncomfortably. “I read a lot about how the Symbols weren’t the tyrants that the Regents have made them out to be. How the Quenching wasn’t a defensive response after the Symbols tried to seize control of the continent. The battlefield accounts…” She shakes her head. “I started spreading the books around, telling people what I’d read. They needed to know. Of course, I got caught.” She sighs. “I ran and hid for a long time, moved from place to place. I thought I was safe here.” Her mouth thins into a grim line.

The familiarity in her story pulls at you, and you nod. “I have had a similar experience, searching for the Symbol.”

“Is it nearby?” She asks. “Can you show me where it is?”

*It would put her in danger,* the Symbol says. *Even saving her will have attracted the Regents’ notice. You should leave.*

In an instant you are above ground, at the gates of the stronghold where Larda kept Partum. It has been reinforced: the walls now bristle with soldiers, who tense at the sight of you. An alarm is raised and within seconds, dozens of crossbows are pointed down at you, while soldiers with spears and pikes and swords stand ready to defend their comrades on the walls.

It lasts only a few moments.

Only a couple meters away is a large gate, spikes at the top of the metal bars. Beyond it is a grand three-storey manor constructed of the same black stone as the wall. Columns and archways of dark maroon wood flank it on both sides, and the whole structure is surrounded by a cobblestone courtyard filled with elaborate planters that house a menagerie of trees and bushes.
A guard stands on the wall above the gate, armed with an unloaded crossbow and clad in chainmail and a thick brown moustache. Given you have appeared almost directly below him, he has not seen you.

You move from light to light, glancing over your shoulder and at the cobwebbed ceilings, unable to shake the sense that something lurks behind you.

At the end of the hallway a painting is mounted on the wall: a magnificent oil portrait easily three times your height. From it gazes a woman with deep black hair pulled back, a pale, cruel face that gazes down from the painting as if rendering judgement with irises of clean white. She wears a sharp blue military coat that needs no pauldrons: her shoulders and frame are sturdy enough.

The painting could have been otherwise entirely blank; the white irises alone identify her. Those eyes watch from every coin, every flag and every seal you have ever seen.

She is the supreme and unquestionable ruler of Astura, a quarter of the civilised world. 

The Mercantine Regent, Larda of the Sparkling Sea.

A mixture of fear and hatred froths in your gut. This is one of the people that led the Quenching. 

They killed all the gods but one.

You force yourself to look away.

You decide to go to the nearest settlement, a mishmash of wooden buildings on brittle stilts separating them from the jungle floor. It is more of a village than a town, which makes it even stranger given how far away it is from the Delineated Districts. You ventured through places like this in your exile, but what sets this one apart is a familiar, gut-wrenching sight: a gallows erected in a wide clearing between homes, and a ring of people spectating an impending execution.

Even so far out from their official borders, the Regents' iron-clad fists loom over the populace.

You linger towards the back of the gathering so as not to be noticed, and open your awareness to the Symbol. Let it see what the world is like under the Regents' rule.

A red-garbed judge stands next to the gallows and recites. "For the crime of dispensing restricted knowledge to those unlicenced to access it, Awoth Riard is sentenced to hang by the neck until dead."

*Restricted knowledge?* The Symbol asks in your mind. *What does that cover?*

*Too much,* you respond. You encountered this particular obstacle many times in your exile. *Practically anything to do with the Quenching, the Symbols or the Regents.*

A woman ascends the gallows' steps. She is dressed in the black-and-gold robes of a Librarian.

[if librarian]
To your dismay, you recognise her. It is the same librarian you threatened years ago to obtain maps of the lands outside the Delineated Districts.

[continue]
*She is being executed for allowing someone to read a book?* The Symbol asks, and its horror comes through even the hazy nature of your mental connection.

*This is the world you're leaving behind.* You watch as the judge fastens the rope around the Awoth’s neck.

Then it occurs to you that you have power now. A Symbol on your side. You can do something about this.

Without haste, you begin to move through the crowd. As people see you, they gasp and jump back. A wave of mutterings trails behind you like a ship's wake.

You reach the front and look the judge in the eye. "Hang me instead."

Stark silence. The judge looks at you, aghast. "Why -- who are you?"

You draw on the Symbol’s power and it tingles in your throat as you speak, lending weight and credence to your words.

"I am the Dreadbard," you say, "and I will not allow an innocent person to suffer for my crimes." 

You turn to face the crowd, whose faces are already hardening into suspicion and judgement. 

"It was I who urged this librarian to allow myself and others access to forbidden books. I threatened her library and her life. She had no choice." You spread your arms out, the shocking mismatch between them on full display. "If you value justice, hang me instead."

The crowd's horror and prejudice at your form take over.
"Hang the beast!"
"It's an abomination!"

The judge sways on the stand, and looks at Awoth. "Is this true?"

Awoth gives you a look, and you nod at her. She, in turn, nods at the judge. "Yes," she says. "It's true."

“Why did you never mention this before?”

She purses her lips, gesturing towards you. “I… I was afraid they would find me.”

As if in disbelief at her own actions, the judge removes the rope from Awoth’s neck and nods towards the gallows’ steps. Relief and disbelief war on Awoth’s face as she practically runs down towards the crowd, who part cautiously around her. 

“I never believed you did it on your own, Awoth,” someone says.

You step up to the gallows and towards the waiting judge. She tugs the rope over your snout and beneath your jaw; it is coarse against your throat. You don't need to breathe, but this will be uncomfortable nonetheless.

The judge pulls the lever. The trapdoor opens beneath you and you plunge down, drawing on your connection to the Symbol to strengthen your body as the rope wrenches against your throat. The power comes in a tingling rush, stopping your neck from breaking. Your airway is closed... but that doesn't bother you.

“You’re free,” you say, and glee jumps in your stomach. “You’re free!”

The Symbol reaches for you, and in an instant, you’re both out of the Forge, in the Old Asturan Jungle above. An easterly breeze rustles the trees, and the sun peeks out from behind a cloud like a face at a windowsill.

“*Now* I’m free,” the Symbol says. “Free of that prison – oh, I’d forgotten what *wind* feels like, what soil feels like!” It steps around the space, digging its toes into the ground, trailing its hand across the vines that snake between the nearest trees.

You too, take a moment of respite, but are aware that the Regents will be closing in. You both need to get far away from the Forge before you can relax.

It is warm to the touch, but no grand aura emanates from it, no visions or imparted knowledge fill your mind. It seems a simple instrument of finality and annihilation.

*We’re so close*, the Symbol says. *So close. Soon, I will be at peace.*

You move to the nearest window, which has sheer white curtains with exquisite embroidered patterns. You see a dozen guards with swords and polearms massing outside the front door to the manor, encircling it.

No doubt they expect that since you entered by way of the gate, that you must leave by normal means of travel as well.

You stretch out your claw towards the sculpture. The Symbol’s power rushes through you and out from your claw, making the air around the sculpture shimmer and weft. 

“The Symbol is and will be as it has always been.”

Gasps sound around the clearing as rust begins to flake off the sculpture.

“It has been a guide and inspiration to countless thousands. The Regents’ actions will never change that.”

The vines and leaves hugging the sculpture retreat into the ground, devolving back to shoots and seeds. Metal brightens until it is as lustrous as when it was forged. Dents fill themselves, and chipped off sections swell back into shape.

“The Lattari Symbol is that of persistence. No matter the Regents’ actions, it persists so long as there are those who remember it.”

You fill yourself to bursting with all the power you can muster. A torrent drives into you, filling you like breath, like water, like lava. The entirety of your skin tingles as you stand poised, the hammer above your head.

Then you bring it down.

The Forge explodes with sound, the roaring of an inferno cascading through the space. Partum is affixed to the anvil, and your grip is affixed to it, a bond unbreakable with anything you can muster. The heat that emanates from it is scorching, and you scream as it scalds your flesh.

A beam of coruscating, ember-red energy blazes from the anvil and towards the Symbol, impacting the barrier and scintillating on its surface. For the first time, you see the crystalline contours of the wall imprisoning the Symbol as the Hammer of Ending’s light splashes across it, revealing its shape.

It begins to sap your strength. The Symbol pours power into you, and just as quickly, it is whisked away in the torrent of absolute destruction.

A hole begins to form in the barrier.

The Symbol is on its hands and knees, staring at you with intent. You are a tether caught in two currents, your joints and muscles stretched almost to breaking point. It is hard to even think.

The barrier burns like a piece of parchment held too close above a candle. The hole spreads, evenly on all sides, and slowly, so slowly, and the beam spears through, striking the Symbol. Even the Symbol’s power starts to deplete. You have stopped screaming by now; the pain is synonymous with existence.

The Symbol slumps over onto the ground, and a sphere of burning red energy bursts from the anvil, cracking and searing the walls of the Forge. The torrent of power the Symbol sends you becomes a mere trickle, the tiniest stream pouring into an ocean.

The Hammer of Ending starts pulling power from you.

You raise it, and bring it down to strike the anvil straight and true. 

A sharp, ringing chime resounds throughout the Forge. In seconds the chime multiplies and the ringing gets faster, a sonic cycle that resonates in your ears, your teeth.

The Symbol sits up, the edges of its being starting to glow and fray. “Oh, I can feel it. Is that… sunlight?”

Light traces up its fingers, up its arms and towards its chest. In the light’s wake, the Symbol begins to dissolve into glowing fragments like fireflies, like spores. The light covers the entirety of the Symbol’s massive being, and that being begins to split up, to dissolve, to scatter. The connection in your mind scrambles, then breaks.

All that is left of the Symbol is a cloud of ethereal fragments, coruscating like diamonds in noonlight, and as you watch, the cloud disperses in all directions, its particles diffusing through the floor, the walls, the ceiling.

Silence reigns.

You stare at the empty space where the Symbol used to be, feel that void in your mind. Jubilance and miserable longing war in your mind, and you crumple down on the floor and for minutes, let those emotions out in tears, in shouts, in the clenching of fists.

"I hope," you say, "I so desperately hope you've found peace."

When you eventually collect yourself and leave the Forge, touching the icon of the marbled anvil that first brought you here all those years ago, you find yourself back in the Old Asturan Jungle.

They are the hardest you have ever lived.

One morning, in the Old Asturan Jungle far, far south of where you were changed, a sprigcatcher sings its shrill song right as you touch the perfect marble anvil sitting alone in the dirt. It pulses with sudden light, and its pulse takes you.

You stand inside a magnificent vaulted space, like the cathedrals you’ve seen depicted in history books. Two rows of smooth stone pillars hold up the ceiling, which bristles with stalactites even as the shape has been moulded by sentient touch. 

The far end of the chamber is lit up with dozens of braziers and candles, silhouetting the shrine in the centre, halfway between you and the other end. It is a raised dais, encircled with five slimmer columns that support a domed roof. The dais houses an anvil as large as a horse, wrought of dark metal that glimmers and shifts like the moonlit sea. Four immense hammers of varying designs hang from racks affixed to the inside of the shrine. Even with your claw’s strength, these would be difficult to lift.

You approach, push off with your ostrich foot and take the steps in one stride. From the centre, you see the far wall clearly, and suck in a breath even though you don’t need to.

The stone at the far end moves like sludge.

Beyond, a giant stirs. 

Somehow, through the stone, you perceive a space made of the same fog that haunts the ocean before dawn. In it sits a blue-skinned being with legs as thick and large as the pillars that support this hall. An immense slab of a back rises as the giant wakes, then turns around and lowers its head to peer through the wall at you.

Its oblong, bald head could have been any human’s if it weren’t for the blue skin and the gargantuan size. It has no mouth, and its nose is the merest slope of skin. Its eyes, by contrast, blaze with red light that is still and constant as the sun.

The Lattari Symbol. It *has* to be.

A storm of emotions tosses within you.

You see them now, a pack of five muscular beasts racing towards you, teeth bared, long strands of saliva trailing from their black muzzles.

You’ve run from people like these for years. No longer.

Hurling yourself forward, you smash through the window with your claw and leap into the open air. The remnants of the curtain billow out around you, masking your descent and allowing you to land among the soldiers, smashing one’s ribs in with the hammer. You hold the hammer in your human hand now, enough power flowing through you to wield it without effort.

Your claw becomes your secondary weapon: two soldiers rush you, and you snap one’s sword in half with your claw while crushing the other’s sword-arm with your hammer. You whirl, driving the first one off balance, then cleave into his shoulder with your claw. They fall before you, screaming in pain.

More of them come, and you let a battle-frenzy take you, leaping, smashing skulls and ribcages, cleaving throats and arms. 

[if befriendedHounds || dominatedHounds]
The hounds you had turned to your side burst from the lower levels of the house, snarling and biting, adding to the carnage, finishing off those you wound.

When it is over, a full dozen bodies lie before you, their blood trickling in rivulets between the cobblestones.

You mentally nudge the Symbol, and in an instant, [[return to the Forge-&gt;Self Transformation]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="120" name="The Regents wish they could purge the citizenry of unsanitary knowledge.

You can feel the Symbol’s anticipation through the connection, and as you turn and walk back down the steps of the shrine away from the anvil, away from the Symbol, that anticipation turns to confusion and concern.

“What are you doing?”

You keep walking.

“We don’t have much time, you have to act quickly!” The Symbol says, an edge in its voice.

“I… can’t kill you,” you say. “You’re too important.”

The Symbol stops silent, pain suffusing its thoughts, and therefore yours. “So, what, you’re going to… you’re just going to *leave me here*?”

“Even though you’re empowering the Regents,” you say, looking at the ground as you walk, “you’re also my best chance against them. And… I can’t kill the last living Symbol. I can’t.”

“No,” pure dread comes through the connection as the Symbol contemplates its future.

“I said I wanted to live, but not like this; I’d rather die than continue on in this cage! Please, please just kill me. Don’t leave me.”
[else]
“No, I can’t keep going like this! Don’t just leave me here, we made a deal!”

[continue]
You reach the marble icon that first transported you here, at the far end of the Forge from the Symbol.

“I’m sorry,” you say. “The world needs you.”

“I trusted you,” the Symbol says. “I thought, after all this time, that someone could end this eternal torment! You were supposed to be my salvation. Instead, all you did was give me hope of an end, and now you’re taking it away.” Anger and despair perfuse its words. “You’re worse than the Regents. Worse.”

You almost look back over your shoulder, but you know that if you do, you won’t be able to follow through with this. You reach out towards the icon.
“Do you think I’ll help you after this?” The Symbol screams behind you. “I hope the Regents carve you up! I hope they put you in a prison just like mine so you can suffer as I have!”

“You’ll help me,” you say. “We are linked; you don’t have a choice.”

You touch the anvil icon, and are gone.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="123" name="The musk in the stacks was smothered by the smell of flint and powder.

You plant your feet wide and stretch your arms out to loom large in their vision. As they approach, you stretch open your jaw, revealing your immense maw and crocodilian teeth. The hounds slow down: they were expecting their prey to run.

You growl at them, infusing the sound with the Symbol’s power. Their ears flatten and they whine, unable to retreat, held in place by your power. You step towards them, slowly, carefully so as not to break your hold over them. By the time you reach them, they have flattened their bodies on the ground in submission. To complete it, you give them each a nip with your front teeth.

When you stand up from the last one, the hounds rise to sit, and when you move towards the manor, they follow you obediently.

&gt; [[Approach the manor.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="125" name="There’s a door on the left wall." tags="" position="800,25" size="100,100">With an effort, you turn your back to the painting and move towards the wooden double swing doors on the left wall. At your push, the hinges stumble off the frame and the doors fall inward, crashing to the ground and making room for the hazy air beyond to whorl around you.

You stride through into a hall with doorways on either side, with sheets of a strange translucent yet pliable material hanging in each doorway, like flexible glass.

The contents of these rooms are ghastly: operating tables with restraints built in, metal trays holding bloody scalpels, forceps, bone saws and other tools. The air has a disconcerting tang, and the further you go, the colder it gets.

You hear movement behind you. You turn to face an indistinct, dark figure that holds something up and sprays you full in the face with a cold liquid.

In moments, dizziness takes you and your vision blurs. The figure merely stands above you as you collapse.

Eventually, you wake.

This needs to be convincing. If Larda doesn’t believe you’re in pain, she won’t let down her guard.

You draw in a deep breath, and amplify that breath with the Symbol’s power. It throbs in your lungs, and pulsates through your throat as you let out a roar. The people shrink back in fear as the metal of the sculpture twists and bends, the ends of lines elongating and sharpening into spikes. Crocodilian faces grow from it, their mouths moving as they snap and hiss at those nearby. Metal shrieks as beams split into tentacles that threaten to ensnare the people around them.

By the time you’ve finished, the refugees are pressed against the wall of the clearing, gazing wide-eyed at what you’ve wrought: a metal monstrosity that leans and hisses as if living.

“The Symbols were defeated by the Regents because they were weak and restrained in their actions, whereas the Regents held back nothing. No longer. The Regents will pay for what they have done, and they will know the fear they’ve inflicted on us all.”

This form, while ghastly to behold, has given you strength and ability over anything else. What human can leap like an ostrich? What human can break blades with their unarmoured flesh? You will not give up such potential. You’ve only begun to take advantage of it.

The first time you came to the Forge, you could barely lift the Hammer of Linking. Now, you heave the Hammer of Excess over your shoulder, and step up to the anvil.

*I will become more powerful than even the Regents.*

You swing.

The impact is crystalline, spreading from the hammer up your arm and permeating through your body like cracks through shattering glass. Your vision goes white and the Symbols’ power floods the conduit between you. You dissolve into a cloud of diamond shards orbiting your beating heart, your awareness as fragmented as your body. Where once the connection between you and the Symbol was tenuous, every fibre of power a careful pull, now you shape it as a smith shapes molten steel, and so you shape yourself.

Slicing at your skin like a surgeon, you amputate your right arm below the elbow. The pain is a distant concept, smothered by the immensity of the Forge’s weight and the magnitude of the Symbol’s power that pours through you. You graft flesh onto the stump, stretching, splitting and moulding it into tentacular strands, garbing it with the colour and mottling exhibited by creatures of the deep sea, filling each tentacle with power and will.

As soon as the shape is in place, impatient, you likewise remove your left leg at the groin, slicing it away with a strand of power stretched thin like a garrote. In its place you create and affix the thick, muscular mass of an elephant’s leg, lengthening it to match your frame. Where the ostrich foot gave you speed and jump height, the elephant’s leg will give you sheer power.

You fling the Forge’s power away from you in a sphere of radiance, and bring yourself back to physical reality. You are reborn, exceeding even your prior form. You flex your right arm, and the mass of tentacles grasps and reaches like fingers in response, the suckers all along them quivering. You stomp your left foot, and the ground rumbles with the impact. Satisfaction spreads through you. You will be unstoppable.

“Congratulations,” the Symbol says.

“Thank you,” you say.

The Symbol shifts. “If you wouldn’t mind –”

The Symbol looks like it is going to protest, but you sense its stunned acquiescence in your mind. “I… I suppose. I never expected to be able to choose, myself.”
[continue]

You heave the Hammer of Reversal above your head, and bring it down. The sound it makes when it hits the anvil is like a cathedral’s worth of stained glass shattering at once. Fragments of light stream from the anvil, plunging to the left and right, crawling along the floor, separating, then rising, forming four ominous silhouettes, once of which you recognise. Larda.

The silhouettes of the Regents stand there, the shards of light within them vibrating. Larda and one other have their hands outstretched towards the Symbol’s prison. The other two stand utterly still, but obviously also concentrating. 

You can feel the current of power flowing from them to the walls of the Symbol’s prison.

Ever since you rose from that glass-cased coffin, you knew you wanted to right this wrong, to return to yourself as you once were. To have your family recognise you again. To not be feared and hunted on sight. 

The first time you came to the Forge, you could barely lift the Hammer of Linking. Now, you heave the Hammer of Reversal over your shoulder, and step up to the anvil.

*This is it, then.*

You swing.

The impact is crystalline, spreading from the hammer up your arm and permeating through your body like cracks through shattering glass. Your vision goes white and the Symbols’ power floods the conduit between you. You dissolve into a cloud of diamond shards orbiting your beating heart, your awareness as fragmented as your body. Where once the connection between you and the Symbol was tenuous, every fibre of power a careful pull, now you shape it as a smith shapes molten steel, and so you shape yourself.

With cleansing, disinfecting white fire you ignite, burning away the lobster claw and the ostrich foot. Like spokes on a wooden wheel they burn away, leaving the core untouched. You distil from them their strength, their agility, and keep those there as ethereal bones, upon which you then layer human muscle and flesh. You feel them form as if putting dislocated joints back into place: painful, but a righteous pain, a correct pain that heralds the beginning of healing.

Your head and neck are not so easily manipulated - you have to be so careful around the brain that you start to hesitate until the Symbol leans in and guides your work, searing precision burns around your brain and spine, leaving them intact and incising all else away for you to replace. The crocodile’s power, then, is gone, but in its place you restore your face, your true face and head as you once knew them, the face you have always had but could not show the world.

When the shaping is done, you stop pouring power through, and lie on the floor of the Forge as the remaining flames burn themselves away to embers on your skin.

You raise your hands – your *hands* – to your face, and run your fingers over your raw skin, relief, blessed relief running through you.

“It’s finished,” you choke out, your voice your own once more, tears running from your eyes past your eyes and into your hair. “It’s finally over.”

The Symbol’s regard through the connection is warm, the pride and support of someone witnessing a friend reach their dreams.

Eventually, you rise. Your arms and legs are as they were. You flex them, feeling the strength coiled within, the one benefit of the transformation that you kept, invisible beneath your human skin.

“Congratulations,” the Symbol says.

In the long years between being transformed and finding the Symbol, you had to keep hidden. When people saw you, they would draw back in fear. Why would you shirk your biggest advantage? Why not intentionally cause fear?

The first time you came to the Forge, you could barely lift the Hammer of Linking. Now, you heave the Hammer of Ultimatum over your shoulder, and step up to the anvil.

*They will shrink in fear at the sight of me. My gaze will drive them to the brink of madness.*

You swing.

The impact is crystalline, spreading from the hammer up your arm and permeating through your body like cracks through shattering glass. Your vision goes white and the Symbols’ power floods the conduit between you. You dissolve into a cloud of diamond shards orbiting your beating heart, your awareness as fragmented as your body. Where once the connection between you and the Symbol was tenuous, every fibre of power a careful pull, now you shape it as a smith shapes molten steel, and so you shape yourself.

You pile power onto your limbs like lava. The agony is but fuel for the transformation. Your ostrich foot becomes larger, tougher, with sharpened metal claws that emerge from its bottom. Your lobster claw sharpens and becomes armoured with scales that bring to mind demon beasts only heard of in myth. You wreath the claw with black fire that makes your mind itch; to others, it will be soul-rending.

Your head swells, extra rows of teeth sprouting from the roof and bottom of your mouth. Your tongue becomes longer, coiling in your mouth like a snake over which you have complete control. Your ancient eyes deepen into pure blackness that hints at the void between stars. 

You open your jaw and swallow the remaining power that the Forge exudes, consuming it like a meal. You stand there, shedding primordial terror like a scent, an aura. You turn your head, and even the Symbol starts when you meet its eyes.

“Congratulations,” the Symbol says.

“Thank you,” you say.

The Symbol shifts. “If you wouldn’t mind –”

“Too val –” the Symbol’s eyes widen. “Don’t. Whatever it is you’re doing, don’t do it. This isn’t what I wanted, this isn’t what we agreed on!”

“It isn’t,” you say, “but it is what’s best for the world.”

You raise the Hammer of Ultimatum, and when you swing, all your vision narrows to the contact point between the Hammer and the anvil. A cacophony like a roaring waterfall shakes the Forge when the Hammer strikes, and for a moment a ghostly voice sounds from the din, asking a question and absolutely demanding an answer from the universe itself.

When you pull the Hammer away from the anvil, a mote of orange-red light, the same colour as the Symbol’s eyes, rests there, pulsing with a rhythm like a heartbeat. It is into this that you pour will and power from your connection to the Symbol, siphoning it yourself instead of it being given to you. The Symbol resists, tugging back on the connection, attempting to keep its personality together, but the Hammer of Ultimatum has been swung, and an answer to its question must be given.

The mote of light grows and grows. Like a vine it sprouts, creeping in tendrils in all directions, forming the outlines of muscles and skin. Before you, the Symbol’s immense body takes shape, towering above you, palpably emanating power that vibrates through your knees. 

The Symbol in the prison wastes away like a corpse.
When the last gap in the light has been filled in with blue skin, the Symbol moves, looking at itself, flexing its muscles.

“Stand back,” it says, and when you do, it hurls a glob of power at the anvil, shattering it into chunks; you turn away as some strike the side of your face.

“They’ll have to rebuild it if they ever want to imprison me here again,” the Symbol says. “Come, disciple. The Regents have persevered long enough. I languished in that prison in despair, but you have shown me what my purpose is.” It leans down towards you, that massive face without a mouth, and yet it speaks. “Their strongholds will burn. Their armies will swear to me or they will die. And at the end, the Regents, too, will swear or die. I will at least give them the choice.

“You freed me and brought me to understanding. You will be my first general, my right hand. Together we will cleanse the world of the Regents in a second Quenching!”

The Symbol gazes at you. Like a shadow of the Hammer you just swung, it demands a response, and whether through devotion or fear, only one is possible.

You leap into the air just as they get close. You sail over them, sprinkling a little bit of power over them, and land behind them. They turn towards you, barking, and just as they’re about to reach you you repeat the trick, feed them a little more power and land behind them once more. 

This time, when they turn towards you, their barking is a little more playful. You keep evading them, laughing as you do, jumping over their heads, side to side, showering them with power in little sprinkles until they’re convinced it’s a game.

When you finally land and stop still, they bound towards you, licking whatever part of you they can reach and wagging their tails.  When you move towards the manor, they follow you obediently.

&gt; [[Approach the manor.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="rise and advance." tags="" position="1425,300" size="100,100">You try to return home, and are hunted by the District Appointed Guards for a week. Your family and friends never see you in this state. For that, you are grateful.

You learn that you do not require food or water or sleep. Your mind remains just as sharp in the black hours, and your stomach may as well have been carved out. Sometimes, you take a drink of water just to remember what it feels like.

You have no companion in your trauma. The abyss in your mind is always there, waiting and, sometimes, welcoming. Loneliness crushes you, and its only counterpoint is the Symbol. Sometimes you imagine its voice, misty and effusive, speaking to you, comforting you. You make up conversations with it in your mind and, to learn how to wield your tongue and teeth, eventually you speak your part of these conversations out loud. Your voice is as gravel on the riverbank, low and sonorous and crunchy with syllables.

You learn not to venture near settlements of any size except by stealth, to steal books and maps. Very few people see you, and even fewer can be trusted. Most of them aid you out of morbid curiosity. Only two individuals in all your travels sympathise with your quest for the Symbol.

Gradually, you become a whisper, a tale told when night falls to scare people.

They call you the Dreadbard.

You prowl the uninhabited wilderness between Delineated Districts, far to the north, then to the west of Astura, combing the ground back and forth, searching for the entrance to the Forge of Creation, where it is written that the Regents imprisoned the Lattari Symbol at the culmination of the Quenching. For what purpose, none of the writings say.

If I were a sick friend, or family member, would you do the same?”

Its judgment is like the blazing jungle sun on the back of your neck. You look up, and the Symbol looks at you with more hardness than before. “If you want my help, this must be the outcome.”

I don’t deserve you.” It bows its head. “I have never had a truer disciple.”

You watch as the Hammer of Ending devours your very essence, the Forge of Creation around you being destroyed.

Your last sight is of the Symbol’s crumbling form reaching for you.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="“Are the other Symbols really dead?”" tags="" position="1637.5,1100" size="100,100">symbolConvoReallyDead: true

The Lattari Symbol nods, solemn and slow. “Gotoren, the Symbol of Ferocity. Alamanati, the Symbol of Sense. Voriosh Tan, the Symbol of Similarity.” Each name seems to reverberate through the space like a gong strike. “They are dead. Slain by the Regents after losing every single person who was ever faithful to them.”

“What are you the Symbol of?”

It has no mouth, but you see its eyes crinkle as if in a wry, self-deprecating smile.

“Persistence.”

“Yes,” the Symbol says. “I just want it to be over.”

The Symbol’s thoughts thrum through the connection, turbulent as rapids. It sits there, on the floor of its prison, and opens up its mind to you. There, among the familiar black despair, a line of grey murk runs like a vein through skin.

“When we first met, all I wanted was to be heard. You didn’t question me. You listened to me.”

“When we visited the place of my ascension, I shared my reasons with you. I felt so powerless, so helpless, for so long. You showed me that even so completely imprisoned, I had the ability to affect my own future by asking you for help. I hadn’t realised that.”

[if hope &gt;= hopeThreshold]
The Symbol looks at the pile of ash where Larda lies. “And… I didn’t really believe a Regent could ever be defeated. But you showed me that was possible too.”

It looks up at you. There’s something in its face that you haven’t seen before: the unearthing of a deep hope. “I know it’s not what we discussed, but… I think I want to live. To get out of this cage. To talk with other people. To feel sunlight and rain.

“It may not be possible. It’ll take significantly more power, more than you may be able to handle. We haven’t had much time. But… if you can do it safely, please try.”

*I was lucky enough to find someone who agreed to help me.*

You take a deep breath, and share something you haven’t told anyone else.

“After Larda turned me into what I am now, in the deepest horror of that experience, I wanted to end my own life. I understand how you feel.”

You get a wordless wave of gratitude through the connection.

*I don’t think it is possible for someone who hasn’t experienced it to understand. Whether it’s in a single, soul-harrowing moment, or a prolonged leaching of light from the world… that state of mind is truly unique.*

“It’s like there’s nothing to redeem existence. The things that kept you tethered, that make it worthwhile to go on, all disappear.”

*It’s more, and less than that. Death becomes *better*, because life is so awful that every moment is pain, and you can’t imagine any future where it gets better.*

In the midst of the melancholy, you feel a mote of pleasant surprise. “I’ve never talked with anyone about this before. It feels good.”

Acknowledgement comes through the connection. You both lapse into silence.
You remain there, basking in it, until the night is upon the desert, and the cold drives you to return.

There is a pause, then a rhythmic, burbling laugh emanates from the Symbol. “Ah, a joke. In all my millennia, there have been less people brave enough to make a joke in my presence than there are petals on a rose.”

“I… well. It isn’t quite the renewal of life I had in mind, but it’s better than this place.” Its voice is wistful. “At least I’ll be able to watch, in a sense, where you go next, even if I can’t walk beside you.”

“This isn’t what I want,” the Symbol says, hurt in every word. “I wanted to end, not to watch, even more a spectator, even more a prisoner, as the entire universe moves around me. Please don’t do this.”

“Of course I have.” 

The Symbol points with a blue finger to places on the walls where the stonework is marred, and to a spot on the ceiling where a chunk of stalactites have been snapped like twigs. 

“Three times. The first time, I never got out of this chamber; Larda responded immediately and we fought. I understand how the magic of this place works now, so if my captivity is ever to end, it must be done in a specific way. You’ll see the results of my other escape attempts in time.”

“A campaign of war cannot be reduced to one swing of the sword,” says the Symbol. “Especially one as long as the Quenching. What do you know of it?”

“It lasted for exactly a century. The Regents claim it was to eliminate corruption and injustice in the Symbols’ followers.”

“Certainly, by extinguishing the sun you could eliminate sunburn,” the Symbol says, clenching an enormous fist. “By the time the Regents had overthrown or usurped the old governments and banded together, only the Symbols possessed sufficient influence to gather people to oppose them. Every attempt at order will necessarily brook deviance, but the Regents did not destroy us because of our corruption. They destroyed us because we were the last obstacle to their dominance of the entire continent.

“As to how… they are unparalleled military leaders, the Regents, but more than that, they are completely immune to moral scruples. You’ll see evidence of this soon enough.”

{embed passage: 'Symbol Conversation Choices'}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="157" name="“How do you know that?”" tags="" position="300,3625" size="100,100">“Larda showed me.

“You think she was bluffing?”

“Of course,” the Symbol says, sardonic. “Though the Regents are still extraordinarily powerful without me, they’ve gotten used to my being there as an additional power source. They will mourn my loss, in the same way a rich merchant mourns the loss of a bet. They’re not used to their power decreasing, no matter how little.”

“From your point of view, since the end of the Quenching," the Symbol says. "But Larda took care to explain to me that time passes far more quickly inside this trap, flowing normally only when someone else is present in the Forge."

The Symbol’s response is edged with surprise. “A… supplicant? Could it be that the Regents have not slaughtered all of my faithful?”

You bow your head. “I know of no other, my lord. The Quenching ended years ago. Speaking publicly of any god is punishable by death.”

The Symbol does not respond.

To undo the changes made to your body, you will need to strike the anvil with the fourth hammer, Hammer of Reversal – *not* the hammer you now hold. It will obliterate you if you direct its power at yourself.”

You put Partum down next to the anvil and look around. You are familiar with the first, the one with the whitewood shaft. The fifth rack is empty, which means it is meant for Partum. The one next to it must be the fourth, making it the Hammer of Reversal.

“What are the other two?” You ask.

“The second is the Hammer of Excess – it is a conduit for multiplicative power. One could, for instance, use it to build a city while expending the effort only to construct a small section. The third is the Hammer of Ultimatum – where the Hammer of Excess spreads its power out, the Hammer of Ultimatum focuses and refines it.”

You look at these instruments, a new thought occurring to you like a fish bursting from a lake.

“I could use these other hammers to change myself, instead of reversing Larda’s experiment?”

The Symbol is silent for a moment. 

“You could,” it says, “but you will never get this choice again.”

You look at the sculpture as you get to your feet. Emblematic of the Symbol, its patterns and lines suggest a hieroglyph, a statement of regality and purpose, but it has been partially claimed by nature, by time.

“Others have it worse. In the end, we all decided we’d rather be apart from all of it. We wandered for a long time before finding this place.” She gestures at the sculpture, then waves a hand in the direction of a stooped, old man. “Karm has done some reading; he recognised it as associated with the Lattari Symbol.

*Meditation, mostly, and active contemplation. A lot of my followers tended towards physical perfection and mastery of their bodies, but I always impressed upon them the value of a calm and self-aware mind.*

*This place was for those that showed me they really understood that lesson. This place is disconnected, even now, from the rest of society. Some of the trees here have persisted for  many human lifetimes. This place has valuable things to teach through its mere existence.*

*And of course, sometimes it's nice just to get away from the rest of the world.*

You’re keeping me from drowning in the same despair that’s taking you.”" tags="" position="450,2425" size="100,100">A warmth, an appreciation, comes steady through the connection as the Symbol thinks on your words.

*That is true. I hadn’t considered that. Let us hope that the end of my life averts the end of yours as well.*

You both lapse into silence.

You remain there, basking in it, until the night is upon the desert, and the cold drives you to return.

I only care about freeing the Symbol from its captivity.”" tags="" position="1775,3850" size="100,100">Larda lets your words trail off into silence, and then she laughs, loud as a thunderstorm, filling the space with noise, her voice a current of malice.

“Such devotion!” She sneers. “Risking your life and those of everyone who aided you on this inane quest, just so a relic of a time long gone can leave the Forge and make some vain attempt to overthrow me. That is zeal indeed, but it is misplaced.”

I need my body back and you’re the only one who can help me.”" tags="" position="1600,1500" size="100,100">It is like two stars in the night sky stare back when you look the Symbol in the eyes. “A straightforward exchange, then,” it says. “You will have the power to transform yourself into whatever form you wish before I die.”

Well spoken.” She squares her feet. “You face your death with courage. I respect that.”

*I… did not even know it was possible to share – or steal – power in this way until the Regents did it to me.* Shame burns through the connection. *It may be that it can only be done by using the Forge, or between certain individuals. Your body has a particular… feel, same as the Regents. Maybe there’s something to that too.* 

*I have certainly never heard of such a thing being done otherwise.* 

“What do you mean, a particular feel?”

*That is the best way I can describe it. I brushed against the consciousness of plenty of my followers back when I was free, in order to provide counsel or advice, but it was like shining sunlight on an oil lamp - even if I’d tried to pour power into them, it would have passed through and done nothing. You and the Regents, your bodies and minds are different. In the sunlight metaphor, you are plants, able to use what I give you… or what you take from me.*
